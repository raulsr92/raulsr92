### Hi there 👋

**raulsr92/raulsr92** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I am an Industrial Engineer. I love ❤ web development and being part of the interface design👨‍💻 . I love ❤ create value content in order to help others to learn something new in the same way I did. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and Java
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on different open source projects
- 💬 Ask me about my videos hosted in YouTube
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Harry Potter (books and movies)
